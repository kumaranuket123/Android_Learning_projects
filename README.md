### Android_Learning_projects
I am on the path of implementing my coding knowledge on building mini Android projects.
there is a lot of things to learn and improve myself.

what i learnt till now in Android development is that :-
1) How to use Intent class on on different objects which helps to redirected from one Activity to another.
2) putting Animation on different objects which helps to give effects like rotation, translation, scaling of different objects.
3) Producing splash screen effects on my apps.
4) Taking values from user and doing calculation on it then give the output effect which feels like
goosebumps.
and many more to go...
